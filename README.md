Hi there, I'm Jose, a beginner web developer with a passion for learning and creating. I've recently started my journey in web development and have been focusing on learning the basics of HTML and CSS.

I'm fascinated by how these two technologies work together to create beautiful and functional websites, and I'm excited to continue honing my skills in this area.

Currently, I'm experimenting with various HTML tags and CSS properties to create simple yet effective web pages. I'm also learning about responsive design, accessibility, and other important concepts that will help me build websites that are both user-friendly and visually appealing.

In my free time, you can find me exploring new coding tutorials, attending web development meetups, or working on personal projects to further strengthen my skills.

I'm eager to collaborate with other developers and take on new challenges, so feel free to reach out and connect with me. Let's build something awesome together!
